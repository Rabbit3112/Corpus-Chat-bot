About: Rob’s foray into wine started directly after graduating college when he came to Napa to work in a tasting room for the summer – before getting a ‘real job’. He became fascinated with wine and the science of winemaking and began to learn everything he could about the process. While interviewing for that 'real job', the interviewer asked him what he had been doing with his time since graduation. After speaking passionately and at length about wine, the interviewer said, 'You seem to love that so much. Why do you want this job?' Rob realized he didn't want it, actually. He thanked the man, and thus began a career in the wine industry. Rob has since earned his MS in Viticulture & Enology from the University of California Davis and worked for many prestigious wineries including Cakebread, Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars, and La Crema. Rob began crafting Jessup Cellars in the 2009 season and took the position of Director of Winemaking at Jessup Cellars in 2010. He now heads up our winemaking for the Good Life Wine Collective, which also includes Handwritten Wines."

        "Answer": "Jessup’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a staple of most Napa Valley winemakers with Jessup offering our 2019 Cabernet Sauvignon for 2024. As with most of our red wines, our winemakers exercise 'The Art of the Blend' by starting with 90% Napa Valley fruit from the Chiles Valley AVA in Northeastern Napa County, then blend in 5% Petite Sirah from the same AVA, 3% Merlot from our Truchard Vineyard in the Los Carneros region, then finish it with 2.1% Cabernet Franc, which is the parent grape of both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, often used in blended wines. Cabernet Franc originated in the Bordeaux region of France and to honor that provenance, we age our 2019 Jessup Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon in 80% new French oak for 22 months. Alcohol content in this varietal is 14.9% with a PH of 3.65. You can purchase our 2019 Cab for $90. The palate of the wine matches the aromatics providing juicy fruit flavors, rich tannins and a long finish. This wine drinks well now however will age gracefully for the next 5-8 years.

This wine has a very different nose and mouth feel than our 2019 Cabernet, presenting a dry, more tannic finish which still feels young but full bodied as it crosses your palate. You could lay this bottle down for another 5-8 years as you wait for it to soften, but if you want to drink it now, we encourage you to pair this wine with a nice Filet Mignon or other red meat. Our Alexander Valley Cabernet is aged in 80% new French oak with an alcohol content of 14.9% and may be purchased for $90 for non-members."

    {
        "Question": "What is the Solera method?",
        "Answer": "The Solera method is a traditional aging and blending process commonly used in the production of fortified wines, including dessert wines like Sherry and Madeira. Here's how it works:\nTiered Stacking: The process begins with a series of barrels or casks arranged in tiers, known as criaderas, with the oldest wine in the bottom tier (the solera) and progressively younger wines in the upper tiers. Fractional Blending: A portion of wine is drawn from the oldest tier (the solera) for bottling, and the same amount is replaced with wine from the tier immediately above it. This process is repeated up through the tiers, with the youngest wine being added to the top tier. Continuous Aging: This fractional blending and aging process continues over many years, resulting in a harmonious blend of vintages. The solera method creates a consistent style and quality in the wine, as the older wines impart their complexity and character to the younger wines. The result is a wine with a unique balance of flavors and aromas that reflects the heritage and craftsmanship of the winemaker."

Try to avoid lighter and more delicate dishes with Zinfandel as the full-bodied wine will over power such dishes. When drinking a Zinfandel like the Jessup Reserve, there are a variety of cheeses that can make this a perfect tasting experience such as bold and tangy blue cheese or Gorgonzola, rich and creamy Brie or aged Cheddar. The bold fruit flavors in the wine will complement the creaminess and pungency of the cheeses."
